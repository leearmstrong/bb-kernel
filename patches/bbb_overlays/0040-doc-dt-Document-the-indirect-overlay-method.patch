 not contain a __symbols__ node, i.e. it was not compiled with the -@ option.
 The __symbols__ node is only required for the target=<phandle> method, since it
 contains the information required to map from a phandle to a tree location.

+The indirect target requires the use of a selector target on the call to
+of_overlay_create_indirect(). I.e. passing the "foo" id will select the target
+in the foo node, "bar" in bar node, etc.
